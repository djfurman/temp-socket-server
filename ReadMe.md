# Temp Socket Server

Need a temporary server to get some testing done using my headless application.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `npm install` to get dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the mock API server

## Disclaimer

This is called "temp-socket-server" for a reason, it's temporary :) This is only to support some local tests for a headless UI application. I don't intend this to be production code.
